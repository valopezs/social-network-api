## Description
This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The API uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## Usage
As a social media startup I want an API for my social media network that uses a NoSQL database, so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Installation
Start the application from the command line:

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- In terminal type ```npm install``` to download the dependencies
- Start the server by entering ```npm start```
- Go to the port on your local host
